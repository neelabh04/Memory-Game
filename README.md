# Memory Game 👋
This is a retro grid-based game as a practice project which I made using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time.

I made this in order understand the concepts of JavaScript.

## Overview 
### Rules
- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
- These cards then disspear
- If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of ths and the cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board

## My process
### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
In this project I tried to understood how JavaScript encorporates the logic build in HTML and CSS. 

I learnt a quite about `eventListener`, `querySelectors`, `callback` functions  and ` Document Object Model` via `innerHTML`  in this project. And how to add the `Math` functions in JS in order to create the logic generating random pieces across board for the game.

I also learnt how to create multiple `div` using JavaScript only and how to work with `array of objects`. 

The tricky part was how to flip the cards back to their orignal place. This was done with the help of `removeEventListener` and setting the array of objects back to null again to restore their initial state. 

Furthermore learnt about how to use `append`, `setAttribute`, `createElement`, `textContent` in order to set the images as a background for an object and printing out the relevant `alert` messages. 

### Continued development
I have done this project in order to understand the concepts of  JavaScript. I will be creating another project with similar idea and try to do more CSS encoding and to deal with more complex problems regarding the same.
